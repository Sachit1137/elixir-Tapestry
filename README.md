# Tapestry Algorithm
Tapestry is a decentralized distributed system. It is an overlay network that implements simple
key-based routing. Each node serves as both an object store and a router that applications can
contact to obtain objects. In a Tapestry network, objects are “published” at nodes, and once an
object has been successfully published, it is possible for any other node in the network to find the
location at which that object is published.
